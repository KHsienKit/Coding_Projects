# Coding_Projects

This is a repository of my personal projects using Python. There are two main sections; Discord Bot and Other Projects. Everything in the Discord Bot was either made from scratch or adapted from Other Projects.

## Discord Bot

All the coding is in th Cogs folder.

###Overwatch Rank Tracker

Adapted from Other Projects to be made usable in Discord.

###TFT Calculator Calculator

Allowed the bot to output an image displaying the probability of hitting a particular champion given a particular game state(eg. Gold, Level, champion tier. etc.)

###Music

An attempt to make a discord bot that can play music. Able to play 1 music at a time but unable to queue up music due to a lack in ability in asynchronous programming.

##Other Projects

###So What Do You Want To Play

First coding project. Made to randomly choose a game to play or activity to do.

###LoL Fill

Second coding project. Made to randomly choose a role to play in League of Legends.

###Overwatch Fill

Third coding project. Made to randomly choose a role to play in Overwatch 2. Added the feature of randomly choosing roles again with the same players without re-running the script.

###Overwatch Rank Tracker

Fourth coding proejct. A change in rank is recorded every 7 wins or 20 losses. However, there was no way to check win or loss progress in game. This project was made using sqlite3 to make a small amd simple database to track a players Win, Loss and Rank for a particular role(Tank, DPS or Support). Later adapted into Discord Bot.

###TFT Calculator

Fifth Project. Made locally first before it was adapted into Discord Bot
